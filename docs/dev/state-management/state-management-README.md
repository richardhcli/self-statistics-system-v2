## Architecture Overview
This project follows a **Hybrid Read-Aside** architecture where Firebase is the source of truth and client-side storage (Zustand + IndexedDB) is a persistent cache.

### State Hierarchy
1. **Global State (Zustand)**: Domain-specific data that must persist and be accessible across features (e.g., Graph Topology, Player Stats). 7 stores total.
2. **Domain Systems (`/systems`)**: Pure logic modules (e.g., `@systems/progression`) containing engine calculations, constants, and state mutation functions. No React or store dependencies.
3. **Server State (Firebase)**: Cloud source of truth. Firebase services in `src/lib/firebase/` manage read-aside sync.
4. **Local State (useState/useReducer)**: UI-only, transient state (e.g., Form inputs, Modal toggles).

## Core Rules of Engagement

* **Read-Aside Master**: Firebase is the source of truth for cloud-backed data. IndexedDB is a persistent cache for fast boots and offline reads.
* **Utility Purity**: Utility functions must be **pure** (Data In → Data Out). They must never call hooks or access stores directly.
* **The Orchestrator Pattern**: Operations spanning multiple stores must be handled by **Orchestrator Hooks** to ensure atomic updates and store decoupling. See [ORCHESTRATOR_PATTERN.md](./ORCHESTRATOR_PATTERN.md) for detailed guidelines.
* **Type Safety**: Always use the modern `GraphState` format; legacy format support has been removed.
* **No Parameter Drilling**: Avoid passing data through multiple function layers. Use the appropriate store hooks or `getState()` for non-React code.

## Quick Decision Tree

**Do I need state?**
→ Does it have to survives page refresh? use Firebase 
→ Is it used by multiple distant features?  
  **YES** → Use Zustand store (see [GLOBAL_STATE.md](./GLOBAL_STATE.md))  
  **NO** → Is it used by adjacent components in the same feature?  
    **YES** → Use local `useState` lifted to common parent  
    **NO** → Use component-level `useState`
