/**
 * Persistence Hook - Simplified Version
 * 
 * With Zustand's persist middleware (with idb-keyval storage), all stores
 * automatically hydrate from IndexedDB on mount. This hook simply:
 * 1. Waits for all stores to finish hydrating
 * 2. Returns initialization state for UI loading screens
 * 
 * Architecture: Hybrid Read-Aside
 * - Read Flow: UI reads from Zustand (hydrated from IndexedDB immediately)
 * - Write Flow: UI → Zustand → IndexedDB → Firebase (async sync)
 * - Sync: Backend sync happens via fetch hooks and debug tools
 * 
 * No manual IndexedDB serialization needed - the persist middleware handles it.
 * Each store persists independently to IndexedDB with automatic version management.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * const { isInitialized } = usePersistence();
 * if (!isInitialized) return <LoadingScreen />;
