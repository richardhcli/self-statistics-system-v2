## 📝 Document Standards

### Immutable Documents
These represent enforceable standards and should not be modified without careful consideration:
- `state-management/GLOBAL_STATE.md` — Zustand store pattern
- `architecture/architecture-lib-vs-stores.md` — /lib vs /stores separation

### Descriptive Documents
These provide context and guidance; updated as the project evolves:
- `ai-guidelines.md` — AI agent reference
- All feature docs, architecture overviews, and current changelog

## 📌 How to Keep Documentation Accurate

1. **After major refactors**: Update [ai-guidelines.md](../ai-guidelines.md) and relevant pattern docs. Create a new refactor-specific changelog. 
2. **After new features**: Update the relevant doc in [docs-features/](./docs-features/)
4. **Version releases** / **Significant changes**: Update [changelog.md](./changelog.md)
