# Changelog: Neural Second Brain Evolution

This document tracks the iterative development of the self-statistics-system.


## Phase 2: Development
Establishing the foundation for multi-device synchronization and persistent cloud storage.

### [v2.0.2] - Obsidian pipeline hardening
- **Emulator Parity**: Replaced legacy `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` usage with `Timestamp.now()` to fix Firestore writes on the emulator. See [functions/src/plugin-sdk/index.ts](functions/src/plugin-sdk/index.ts).
- **Resilient HTTPS Ingest**: Wrapped Obsidian ingest endpoint in structured `try/catch`, surfacing JSON errors instead of silent 500s. See [functions/src/plugins/obsidian-integration/api.ts](functions/src/plugins/obsidian-integration/api.ts).
- **Green E2E Harness**: Emulator polling script now passes end-to-end for submit → queue → AI tagging → XP update. See [testing/testing-backend/testing-emulator/test-obsidian.py](testing/testing-backend/testing-emulator/test-obsidian.py).
- **Documentation**: Added Functions runbook and plugin style guide for future integrations. See [documentation/backend/functions/firebase-functions.md](documentation/backend/functions/firebase-functions.md) and [documentation/backend/functions/plugins-style-guide.md](documentation/backend/functions/plugins-style-guide.md).

### [v2.0.3] - Synchronous journal pipeline
- **journalPipeline**: New HTTPS endpoint that ingests a journal entry, calls the AI gateway, updates graph topology and XP, and returns the result in one call. See [functions/src/plugins/journal-pipeline/api.ts](functions/src/plugins/journal-pipeline/api.ts).
- **Graph Upserts**: Shared graph writer keeps `progression` rooted manifests in sync while adding nodes/edges from AI output. See [functions/src/services/graph-writer.ts](functions/src/services/graph-writer.ts).
- **AI Client**: Centralized HTTP client for the AI gateway with emulator awareness. See [functions/src/services/ai-client.ts](functions/src/services/ai-client.ts).
- **Tests**: Added a TypeScript harness mirroring the Obsidian polling test. See [testing/testing-backend/testing-emulator/test-obsidian.ts](testing/testing-backend/testing-emulator/test-obsidian.ts).

### [v2.0.1] - plugin ecosystem
- **Plugin SDK**: Created a constrained Firestore access layer (`PluginSDK`) that ensures plugins can only touch user-scoped collections. See [functions/src/plugin-sdk/index.ts](functions/src/plugin-sdk/index.ts).
- **Async Job Queue**: Introduced a job lifecycle system (queued → processing → completed/failed) for async integrations, stored in `users/{uid}/jobs`.
- **Obsidian Integration**: Implemented HTTPS ingest endpoint plus Firestore-triggered worker for journal ingestion, AI tagging, and XP updates. See [functions/src/plugins/obsidian-integration/](functions/src/plugins/obsidian-integration/).
- **Mock AI Gateway**: Added a mock microservice endpoint to simulate external AI provider latency. See [functions/src/microservices/ai-gateway.ts](functions/src/microservices/ai-gateway.ts).
- **Test Harness**: Added Python polling script for emulator verification. See [testing/testing-backend/test-obsidian.py](testing/testing-backend/test-obsidian.py).

## Phase 1: Demo

### Finalization / debugging

### Gemini 3 hackathon submission: 
Roughly at this point. 

### [v1.7.0] - Progression System & RPG Status Views
- **Progression System (`@systems/progression`)**: Extracted all game logic into a pure, side-effect-free module at `src/systems/progression/`. Includes the propagation engine, EXP scaling formulas, logarithmic level curve (`Level = floor(log2(EXP + 1))`), state mutations with level-up detection, and an orchestration layer.
- **7 Core Attributes**: Defined Vitality, Intellect, Wisdom, Social, Discipline, Creativity, and Leadership as archetypal hubs. AI classification is guided toward these attributes but never forced.
- **Status View (RPG Dashboard)**: Built a 4-section character sheet: 7-axis Recharts radar chart, attribute grid cards with icons/level/progress bars, recent neural impact list (last 5 entries), and skill clusters grouped by governing characteristic via BFS.
- **Level View**: Global level badge computed from total XP, gradient progress bar toward next level, and top 3 contributor nodes by EXP.
- **Recharts Integration**: Added `recharts` as a production dependency for statistical visualization.
- **`@systems/*` Path Alias**: Added TypeScript and Vite alias for the new systems directory.
- **AI Prompt Refinement**: Updated `CHARACTERISTIC_ABSTRACTION_PROMPT` for organic-but-guided classification toward the 7 attributes.
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Deleted 6 legacy files from stores/lib that contained game logic previously scattered across the codebase.

### [v1.6.0] - Complete overhaul of backend
- **Firebase Backend**: Journal, graph, and user settings all stored in Firebase Firestore.
- **Hybrid Read-Aside Architecture**: Firebase as the backend source of truth; Zustand + IndexedDB as a persistent cache for fast boot and offline reads.
- **Graph Read-Aside Service**: CDAG topology uses a manifest-first hydration pipeline with 30-minute TTL for full fetches.
- **Journal Read-Aside**: Tree index drives lazy month-range fetches from Firebase; entries cached in IndexedDB.
- **Authentication**: Google Sign-In + Anonymous Guest with automatic profile seeding on first login.
- **Debug Datastores**: Split debug interface for inspecting and reconciling local vs. backend state.
- **Force Sync Panel**: Manual Firestore snapshot fetching and store hydration for recovery.

### [v1.5.0] - The Modular Journal Refactor
- **Self-Contained Journal Feature**: Completely refactored the journal feature to be a fully modular, self-contained React component.
- **Simplified State Management**: Replaced Zustand local store with simple React useState for component-scoped UI state (dropdowns, forms, processing).
- **Improved Data Flow**: Journal entries now update the store **immediately** with loading placeholders before AI processing, ensuring responsive UI.
- **Cleaner App Integration**: Simplified `app.tsx` to use the new `<JournalFeature />` component with a clean integration callback interface.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated `features-journal.md` with comprehensive architectural documentation, data flow diagrams, and usage examples.
- **Type Safety**: Fixed type inconsistencies in journal entry utilities with proper month normalization.

### [v1.4.0] - The Visualization Refinement
- **Perfected Concept Graph**: Implemented a stable Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) layout using a layered ranking algorithm.
- **Ultra-Rigid Snapping**: Developed a custom D3 force tick handler that forcibly aligns nodes to their target grid coordinates, eliminating jitter and elastic bounce.
- **Rank Swapping**: Added vertical drag-and-drop reordering within topological columns.
- **Multi-Node Selection**: Introduced a Set-based selection state with relationship highlighting (glow effects for ancestors/descendants).
- **Style Fixes**: Resolved D3 namespace and type errors across the `visual-graph` and `developer-graph` modules.

### [v1.3.0] - The Bulletproof Refactor
- **Architecture Migration**: Full migration to the **Bulletproof React** project structure (Features, Lib, Stores, Hooks, Components).
- **Standardized Naming**: Converted all files to `kebab-case` and centralized module exports through `index.ts` barrels.
- **Discord-Style Settings**: Implemented a two-column persistent settings interface with sub-views for Status, Profile, AI Features, and Privacy.
- **AI Config Panel**: Added UI for model selection (Flash vs Pro) and temperature tuning.
- **Data Wipe Safety**: Added a "Type 'DELETE' to confirm" modal for catastrophic factory resets.

### [v1.2.0] - Gamification & Propagation
- **EXP Engine**: Developed the "Path-Weighted Cumulative Averaging" algorithm for upward experience propagation.
- **Player Statistics**: Created a character sheet system tracking levels, cumulative growth, and domain power levels.
- **Hierarchical Metadata**: Refactored the Journal Store to store EXP snapshots at the Day, Month, and Year levels.
- **Delta Tracking**: Added "EXP Gained Today" and "EXP Gained Yesterday" comparisons to the Stats Header.

### [v1.1.0] - AI & Connectivity
- **3-Layer Classification**: Developed the Gemini pipeline to extract Actions -> Skills -> Characteristics from unstructured input.
- **Voice Ingestion**: Integrated browser Microphone API with a real-time canvas-based oscilloscope and transcription service.
- **Outbound Webhooks**: Added a real-time JSON broadcast system with diagnostic transmission logs.
- **Obsidian Sync**: Implemented Local REST API integration to write Markdown notes directly to the user's local vault.

### [v1.0.0] - Foundations
- **Local-First Persistence**: Initialized IndexedDB layer for browser-based data storage.
- **Unified State**: Established the `AppData` master snapshot model.
- **Data Portability**: Implemented JSON Import/Export for full database backups.
- **Debug Tools**: Built the Batch Injection panel for automated testing with AI and Manual datasets.
